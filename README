LANGUAGE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==================================

Now that you have your language file, you must place it in Vanilla's language
folder. Your language file should be contained within its own folder. The path
to your language file should be similar to this:

/path/to/vanilla/languages/language_name/definitions.php

Once your language is in the correct place, you can enable it in the settings
tab's "Language Management" form.
